#    frog_lily.py: a solution for the classic problem presented by Christopher D. Long in https://twitter.com/octonion/status/1630687525567070213
#                  which consists in "Here's a classic. A frog is facing a line of 10 lily pads. 
#                                     With each jump, the frog moves forward, landing on one of 
#                                     the lily pads in front of it uniformly at random. 
#                                     What's the expected number of jumps required for the frog to reach the last lily pad?"
